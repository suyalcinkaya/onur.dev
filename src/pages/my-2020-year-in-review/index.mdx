2020 is probably the best and the worst year I've ever had. I'll try to summarize my notions about it.

---

An unexpected COVID-19 pandemic caught our lives unawares. Some of us lost their family, friends, and familiars, some of
us couldn't accomplish their goals.

I still remember the day that my company at that time sent us to our homes for an unknown date. We were all laughing and
making jokes about it and thinking that people are just exaggerating it. Well, it turns out we all got mistaken. People
started to get sick and die everyday and we never left our homes at least for 3 months. Scary, right? Who would believe
that kind of sh\*t? It's like we are living in a post-apocalyptic world or a movie scene but we all had it. And now, we
learned to living with it.

The good news is that the vaccinations are started and —hopefully— the things will get better day by day. I have a lot
of optimism and excitement with 2021.

As I mentioned; pandemic was the worst part of my year indeed, but the best part was _**setting sail for a new life**_.

- **Moved to Berlin** — I've always dreamed living and working in Europe and I was finding myself literally crying at
  the airport everytime going back to Turkey. I couldn't even imagine such a thing. And there is fact that I never lived
  outside of Turkey, not even by myself in Turkey. So, that's the biggest accomplishment I've had this year.
  [You can read my blog post about it in _Turkish_](/bir-yazilimci-olarak-turkiyeden-gitmek-bolum-1-nedenler). I also
  feel so lucky to get started with my current company in my new life. Their ambition and values that they care about is
  aligning perfectly with my expectations. Hopefully I'll get better everyday and keep contributing more.
- **Much healthier, much stronger** — I was around ~97 kgs at my heaviest in the beginning of pandemic (middle of
  March). Since we were all stuck at our homes, I thought it will be a great opportunity for me get in shape. Then I
  started to eat healthy —like extremely— and do my bodybuilding workouts at least 5 times per week. At the end of 3
  months around middle of June, I finally down to ~80 kgs, got much healthier and stronger. Since then, I'm still eating
  healthy —not extremely— and doing my workouts at least 4 times per week plus abs.
- **Rebuilt my website** — My website has transformed over the years from a static HTML site; to Create React App, to
  GatsbyJS, and finally to "Next.js + MDX + Chakra UI" combo. I hope you are enjoying it. Feel free to drop your
  thoughts or feedbacks via e-mail or twitter. Also, I'm thinking about switching Chakra UI with Tailwind CSS. I always
  followed and enjoyed using Tailwind CSS since it came out. There are some advantages and disadvantages in terms of
  performance and clean code. I'll evaluate and make a decision about it soon.
- **Published 6 blog posts** — not too much but I still see it as a great accomplishment. 3 of them draw a quite nice
  attention from you.

  - [What I’ve Learned From Working With HTML5 Video Over A Month](/what-i-have-learned-from-working-with-html5-video-over-a-month)
- **New skills** — I'm always enjoying developing myself with the new and latest technologies. Next.js and React Native
  are the ones that I've enjoyed most in this year. For 2021, my biggest wishes are to learn Figma and German.
- **Created 2 mixtapes** — It's been a while (I mean years) since I created my last mixtape. I couldn't find enough time
  and motivation due to my work life unfortunately. But thanks to pandemic (what?), I bought a DJM-450 and at least had
  a time and energy to contribute myself with creating 2 delicious mixtapes. I'll definitely produce more in 2021.
